# State Alchemist

I am an alchemist.

I build tools to help people achieve their goals. 

I believe, a good tool not only increases productivity but also changes and transforms people.

# What I Create

* [Zaruba](https://github.com/state-alchemists/zaruba): Zaruba is a task runner and CLI utility. It helps you write, generate, and run your tasks with ease.
* [Tocer](https://github.com/state-alchemists/tocer): Tocer is a script to help you write documentation. You start with TOC, write some code examples, and tocer will handle the rest. Your documentation can be your test.
* [Amalgam](https://github.com/state-alchemists/amalgam): Amalgam is a demonstration of microservices-ready monolith. Fully built by using [Zaruba](https://github.com/state-alchemists/zaruba)
