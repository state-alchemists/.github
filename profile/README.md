# State Alchemist

I am an alchemist.

I build tools to help people achieve their goals. 

I believe a good tool not only increases productivity but also changes and transforms people.

# What I Create

* [zrb](https://github.com/state-alchemists/zrb): Zaruba is a task runner and CLI utility. It helps you write, generate, and run your tasks with ease.
* [Amalgam](https://github.com/state-alchemists/amalgam): Amalgam is a demonstration of microservices-ready monolith. Fully built by using [Zaruba](https://github.com/state-alchemists/zaruba)
